Thank you for downloading KanColleTool.

Note that you need a compatible Flash Player installed before the viewer will work.

Chrome has its own embedded Flash Player, which can't be used by other programs;
You need the standalone version, the same one used by Firefox and others, which is NP-API.

You can download the latest version at:

http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/

...and if you're using Chrome, click "Get Flash for another device/browser" and choose
the NP-API option.

This version has been compiled for Microsoft Windows XP and above. The KCT team strongly
recommends updating your OS to Windows 7 or later, as some parts of KCT may eventually
drop Windows XP support. 

Should you have any issues please raise a ticket on our GitHub, at:

Thanks again and please enjoy KCV!
